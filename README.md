## Description: 
The pacmen factory web page uses HTML, JS and CSS to create the interaction between the user and the elements on the screen.
Here you will be able to create multiple pacman figures and make them bounce from one side of the screen to the other while you manage their speed.

## Usage: 
It helps to understand how to use html adding elements into the DOM and giving them interactivity with the user using buttons.
After download the repo, please open the index.html file. here you will find to buttons:
1. Add PacMan: each click will add a new pacman in a random space of the screen
2. Start Game : will make the Pacmen start to move through the screen. with each click they will start increasing their speed.

## Roadmap
